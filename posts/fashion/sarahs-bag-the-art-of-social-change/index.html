For some, handbags are like shoes, collecting all colors, textures, and styles to be prepared for the most impromptu of fashion emergencies. On the other hand, some women curate exquisite, one-of-a-kind investment collections, gathering some of the rarest and most exclusive pieces, reselling pieces as needed. With the rise of interest in sustainable fashion, sustainable business practices, and philanthropy, more designers are building their brands upon strong foundations of economic empowerment, community improvement, and social change. This three-pronged foundation does more than simply provide income and skills. In many instances, these kinds of initiatives seem to directly affect the enhancement of women’s human rights and economic growth. Several organizations, such as the International Center for Research on Women (<a href=http://www.icrw.org/what-we-do/economic-empowerment title=ICRW>ICRW</a>), firmly believe the economic empowerment of women has tremendous, long-lasting, and positive affects upon families, communities, and countries in which women reside, bridging the gap towards attaining a improved quality of life. These ideals have created a steadily increasing social awareness to create and purchase fashion accessories that are sustainable and provide artisans a liveable wage. If you have been searching for ways to purchase fashion that looks good and does good, allow me to introduce you to an amazing brand that embodies these ideals: SARAH’S BAG.</p><p>As one of the most successful social entrepreneurship brands in the Middle East, SARAH’S BAG has captured the attention of women from Tokyo to Caracas. From their atelier and studio in Beirut, SARAH’S BAG has proved itself to be an endearing and effective example of social change, focusing on the best ways to serve and improve their respective community. While handbags are their main product, they also offer rings, bracelets, kaftan, and more. SARAH’S BAG Founder and Creative Director, Sarah Beydoun, has done an excellent job in bringing Middle Eastern pop culture to an international audience. Coming of age during Lebanon’s sixteen-year civil, Sarah and other Beirut-based designers are determined to aid in rebuilding Beirut’s cultural life through their creative passions. Through creating SARAH’S BAG, Beydoun has helped revive and reinvent the region’s rich traditions of craftsmanship, embroidery, crocheting, and textile making. But in my opinion, another aspect of SARAH’S BAG has created a legacy and social impact that will endure for years to come.</p><p>Beydoun studied Sociology at the American University of Beirut. But her experiences at the Université Saint Joseph opened her eyes to the seemingly infinite cycle of a social problem that affected the women she came in contact with each day. While researching for her thesis on prostitution in Lebanon, Beydoun worked at <a href="http://www.daralamal.org/" title="Dar el Amal">Dar el Amal</a> (House of Hope), an NGO started in 1970 to aid at-risk youth, prevent young girls and women from experiencing abuse, exploitation, and prostitution, and rehabilitate former prostitutes and ex-prisoners. During Beydoun’s time with Dar el Amal, the idea for SARAH’S BAG was born. She personally trained and worked with women prisoners and ex-prisoners, teaching them her patterns for a variety of bag designs. Starting with only 12 bags, Beydoun has created a network of over 150 artisans who create each bag she offers, stitch by stitch. Some bags take well over 20 hours to create, featuring Arabic calligraphy and lines from the songs of famous Arab singers like the most beloved, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Kulthum title="UMM KHALTHOUM">Umm Khalthoum</a>.</p><p>SARAH’S BAG has garnered international accolades for their successful model of social entrepreneurship, with recognition from the <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/" title="British  Council">British Council</a>, <a href="http://www.imarabe.org/" title="Institut du Monde Arabe">the Institut du Monde Arabe</a>, and the <a href="http://www.kennedy-center.org/" title="Kennedy Center">Kennedy Center International Committee on the Arts</a>. Owning a SARAH’S BAG creation is like carrying the stories and hopes of several women wherever you go. After an artisan has completed their training, they are encouraged to train other women in their neighborhoods and villages, continuing the positive cycle of economic empowerment and social entrepreneurship and change. Several SARAH’S BAG artisans have recalled how their work boosts their confidence, strengthening them in pursuing their goals. And this confidence shines in their work.</p><p>Check out some of my favorite bags from the SARAH’S BAG Spring/Summer 2013 collection below:</p><p><a href=/images/002_sarahsbag.322b.jpg><img src=/images/002_sarahsbag.322b.jpg alt=002></a> <a href=/images/003_sarahsbag.3af4.jpg><img src=/images/003_sarahsbag.3af4.jpg alt=003></a> <a href=/images/004_sarahsbag.865a.jpg><img src=/images/004_sarahsbag.865a.jpg alt=004></a> <a href=/images/005_sarahsbag.533a.jpg><img src=/images/005_sarahsbag.533a.jpg alt=005></a> <a href=/images/006_sarahsbag.7240.jpg><img src=/images/006_sarahsbag.7240.jpg alt=006></a> <a href=/images/007_sarahsbag.42b2.jpg><img src=/images/007_sarahsbag.42b2.jpg alt=007></a> <a href=/images/008_sarahsbag.3eb1.jpg><img src=/images/008_sarahsbag.3eb1.jpg alt=008></a> <a href=/images/009_sarahsbag.0d70.jpg><img src=/images/009_sarahsbag.0d70.jpg alt=009></a> <a href=/images/010_sarahsbag.e1b7.jpg><img src=/images/010_sarahsbag.e1b7.jpg alt=010></a> <a href=/images/011_sarahsbag.a65e.jpg><img src=/images/011_sarahsbag.a65e.jpg alt=011></a></p><p>SARAH’S BAG is available in several boutiques across the globe, including locations in Africa, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and the United States.
