excerpt: "Experimentation can add a renewed sense of enjoyment within fashion design. By using various fabrics, techniques, and applications, a designer can avoid becoming predictable. While it is necessary to maintain a consistent brand image, designers providing new interpretations of creativity are highly anticipated and desired. Fashion is mainly an arena of chance and risks. The key to success lies within finding the balance between change and authenticity by providing something that is both new and familiar."

Experimentation can add a renewed sense of enjoyment within fashion design. By using various fabrics, techniques, and applications, a designer can avoid becoming predictable. While it is necessary to maintain a consistent brand image, designers providing new interpretations of creativity are highly anticipated and desired. Fashion is mainly an arena of chance and risks. The key to success lies within finding the balance between change and authenticity by providing something that is both new and familiar. The Fall/Winter 2013 collection from UAE-based designer, Judith Duriez of ARABESQUE is a stunningly elegant example of this idea.

The beautifully crafted collection was showcased at their Abu Dhabi and Dubai showrooms in early September for their valued clientele before being released publicly. The collection features an autumnal colour palette of grayish blue, ash, ivory with accents of pale lavender and burgundy and highlights of electric royal blue and bronze. Each abaya is further embellished with geometric, floral, or organic-patterned laces and hand embroidery. Judith asserts her romantic side and strikes an artful balance between futuristic minimalism and the pared-down luxury that reflects the spirit of ARABESQUE. The collection’s geometric patterns are softened by delicate, sheer overlays of breath-weight silk chiffons, Tulle, and fine French laces. This collection is undoubtedly ARABESQUE and maintains their valued approach towards gracefulness.

The Daywear segment features gracefully subtle designs with sleek, almost aerodynamic lines and hand embroidery. The Signature cut abaya has been reinterpreted with floral French laces in frill and corsage patterns on the collar and tailored sleeves. The Evening wear segment proves Judith’s refined design tastes through luxuriously innovative, gravity-defying silhouettes, swirls of air-infused chiffon, wisps of eyelash lace, stunning overlays of guipure, brocade, intricate hand embroidery, and dazzling Lurex laces. With a rich monochromatic colour scheme, each creation becomes the essence of glamour, elegance, and sophistication with modern style.

Judith Duriez studied fashion design at the prestigious Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture de Paris before being offered an apprenticeship at Chanel. It was within this creatively fertile environment that she perfected her skills, working with master craftsmen for some of the most renowned French Haute Couture houses. Seduced by the exceptional richness of Middle Eastern heritage, ARABESQUE quickly gained an honoured reputation throughout the GCC for its intricate combination of Eastern and Western inspirations. Judith designed her first abaya as a special request and has been driven ever since by her own determination to create stylish and exquisitely graceful collections. Through her use of bespoke French tailoring, fine workmanship, and flawless construction and finishing, ARABESQUE will continue to be the brand of choice for many.
