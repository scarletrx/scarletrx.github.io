excerpt: "Ideally, our wardrobe should be flexible, made up of a balanced ratio of essential to special occasion garments, along with accessories. At times, our wardrobe seems to have taken one too many (or not enough) growth pills and we can find ourselves overwhelmed. But what if I told you there was a collection of garments, perfectly suited to go from casual to elegant in minutes?"

Our lives have become jam-packed with personal interests, appointments, meetings, work, family life, and countless other events. And it seems as though there are not enough hours in the day to handle everything. But before we even step out into our day, the first question we tend to face is, “What am I going to wear?!” Anxiety? You don’t know the half of it. From khumur (headscarves) to abayat (outerwear), we have choices and options that might make some of the most efficient stylists’ heads spin. And many events in our lives call for different styles of garments, from unadorned to stunning. Ideally, our wardrobe should be flexible, made up of a balanced ratio of essential to special occasion garments, along with accessories. At times, our wardrobe seems to have taken one too many (or not enough) growth pills and we can find ourselves overwhelmed. But what if I told you there was a collection of garments, perfectly suited to go from casual to elegant in minutes? Let me introduce you to LAMLI.

Every now and then, a brand comes along that understands simplicity and comfort do not equal drab. Today, that brand is LAMLI. From their design workshop in Toronto, LAMLI is an excellent model of minimalist luxury, providing the ease of t-shirts in the elegance of flowing dresses, giving you the choice to accessorize as much or as little as you desire. Founded in 2010 by long-time friends, Lamia Al Saleh (Lam) and Linda El Shami (Li), the brand was born on a summery day on the beaches of Dubai. Their obsession with finding “the perfect dress” grew out of their frustration with choices that were too revealing and overly embellished. They desired comfort, clean lines, and quality construction. By combining elements and ease of t-shirts and sweaters with quality fabrics, silhouettes, and colours, they have created a culture of simplicity, individuality, creativity, and sophisticated living.

It is nice to see a balanced line of elegant essentials/basics and classy casual apparel. I am especially drawn to the [African Jalabiya][1], the [Bow Dress][2], the [T-Shirt Dress][3], and the [Cowl Dress][4]. You can see them and the rest of LAMLI’s Spring/Summer 2013 collection below:
