#Writing on the Web with Markdown

*_This is a sample text for testing [Markdown]._

##What is Markdown?

Markdown is a writing format allowing writers, journalists, bloggers, and other wordsmiths to easily write meant to be *easy to read &amp; write*. Writers normally do not want to bog down their posts, novels, and other measures of prose with HTML tags. They want the ease of writing naturally for a markedup enivronment.  

This is the beauty of Markdown. It's simplistic yet robust and is fairly easy to use, even for those who usually shun writing on the web. [Markdown]:http://whatismarkdown.com/
